# Pathways

The Pathways are ancient cosmic gateways that connect the diverse worlds of the Constellara Cluster. These mysterious portals, activated once a year by the alignment of the stars, allow for interstellar travel, trade, and conflict. Their origins remain shrouded in mystery, but the Star Sages, dedicated to understanding the Pathways, speculate they were built by an extinct advanced civilization.

The Pathways are more than just portals; they are a source of wonder, danger, and opportunity. The volatile antimatter they utilize can cause mutations, leading to the birth of psions â€“ individuals with extraordinary abilities. Path Hunters roam the cluster, seeking new Pathways to claim fame and fortune.

The Pathways are a vital part of life in the Constellara Cluster, shaping its civilizations, conflicts, and destinies.
