Kvir is an Imperial archaeologist and adventurer, and a damn good one, who finds herself on the outs after a recovery went sideways. Meanwhile, she is being recruited by an eccentric merchant to lead an expedition off the edge of the map seeking after legends. Now, Kvir races against her mistakes to discover ancient ruins, learn lost magics, and prevent the rise of a new warlord who would wipe her home off the map.

Set in the same world as Decemilia Verba and the Sunset Kingdom series.

This didn't go well, and is kind of an unhinged mess. Starting a new, highly demanding job will do that to you. It will require heavy editing before I can release it.
