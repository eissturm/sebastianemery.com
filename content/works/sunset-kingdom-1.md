Far to the west, at the edges of the known world, lies Erazel, the Sunset Kingdom, a lone beacon of civilization in the wild barbarian lands of a once great empire, though many fear the kingdom's time has come. The royal line of Chalent has extinguished itself in a blood feud with one of their former vassals turned royal rivals, House Aldrimar, who themselves are on the verge of falling apart.

Henric Aldrimar is a boy of fourteen forced to shoulder the burden of an entire noble house far before he was ready. Caught in the games of the Erazi nobility and their new foreign king, he must navigate the treacherous waters of politics and war to save his family and his people from destruction, while being forced to explore the ancient secrets his father died to find and his grandfather nearly tore the kingdom apart to protect.

*Spring of Black Flowers* is a story of politics, intrigue, and legends best left buried lest they change the world forever.

*Spring of Black Flowers* was the first novel I wrote, and the possible first in a *Sunset Kingdom* series.
