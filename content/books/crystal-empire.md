> “I cried the first time I saw it too,” Mal said. “Though, I was standing on the other side. Where I am from, the Empire, we shut all this away, guard against it. I thought then that was our great sin, but now, after today? We are wrong about so many things. I was nearly twenty the first time I ventured out beyond the Wall, beyond the planned order of everything, and even then my eyes were only half open to what there was to see out here.”

> “It’s beautiful,” Demara said, struggling to wrap her head around just how vast the horizon stretching before her was. She could spend her whole life wandering and never see all of it, she was sure.

*God is dead, but somebody still has to do the job.*

*For almost a thousand years the people of the Crystal Empire elect one of their own to be their God, to assume the mantle of authority and power over all creation, and to burn away in doing so.  It is through this succession that the Crystal Empire has maintained its peace and stability for so long.  Yet beyond the great crystalline walls that serve as the empire’s borders, each new god brings a change.  Where once there was a forest may be a desert, where there were mountains may now be a sea.  Temperate lands may freeze, or be washed away by constant deluge.  It is from this rough, unpredictable fringe of the world that our unlikely heroine comes.  Demara, a young woman from an insignificant tribe scratching out a living at the edge of the world, is the last person anyone would expect to set the world right again, yet through her determination, cleverness, and with some help from her friends, that’s just what she is going to do.*

*The Crystal Empire is an epic fantasy trilogy featuring compelling characters, adventure through a fantastic world, insidious intrigue, secrets lost to time, and spectacular magical crystal combat.*
