*River Song has left the Library. River Song has been saved.*

This 2017-era Doctor Who fanfiction is set post-canon of the main Doctor Who TV show. At the time, I had sort of envisioned this as how I might pilot a season of the show with River Song as a companion, and exploring the kind of stories that could be told with a regenerating Time Lord companion who is NOT rooted in 21st century Earth.

It's a new Doctor, a new River, and no spoilers.
