Ten thousand magical words are a listening experience unlike any other, if you can recite them perfectly. One of the only men who can is in the city for just one night, for just one performance that cannot be missed.

This award winning novella is a story of magic, music, and the power of what words mean to each of us.

Decemilia Verba won the r/FantasyWriters monthly short story contest in November 2014, and was featured in the *Champions* Anthology collected and edited by Alex S. Bradshaw. 

## Praise for *Decemilia Verba*

> "...Here, read a tale you will recall five years from now, as you stand someplace dull and consider the faces of strangers and see ordinary souls transformed to players in a grand heroic epic, each a hero to the music they almost catchâ€¦ *Decimilia Verba*."
**- Raymond Elmo on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31373235-champions?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=jdJnK2oJ9M&rank=1)**
