Gosh I should set a reminder or something...

My professional life overshadowed my authorial one most of May. Between sick kids and making up a new job role as a I go, I didn't get much writing done. Though what I did write I'm pretty proud of. These are some of the best chapters of Crystal Empire I've written yet.

I also spent some time with the Starchasers crew in May. It's good to be back with that chaotic group of ragamuffins, doubly so since it was just a fun little side-story.

This is a short one this month. If you were hoping for more details on something, @me on bluesky. Thanks for reading!
