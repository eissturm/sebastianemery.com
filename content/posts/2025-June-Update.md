Progress on Crystal Empire has been slow and not very steady. Work's been a bit of a mad dash lately, and it's been harder to get back into this crystalline state of mind. We did hit 73% of the projected word count with about 10 chapters left in the outline. I have a feeling [*Imperial Heart*](/books/crystal-empire-2) is going to come in a bit above its planned 100,000 words.

We're also making some progress on the [Constellara Project](https://pathsofconstellara.com)'s first anthology. I'm excited to be lauching a few sample stories on the website. We've created a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/PathwaysofConstellara) for anyone interested in sponsoring the project!

Overall, June was a month of quiet progress on several fronts. Nothing spectacular to announce, but several things are closer now than they've been. Can't wait to share more soon.

Thanks for reading,
- Sebastian
