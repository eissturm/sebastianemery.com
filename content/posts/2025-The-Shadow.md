Danen opened his eyes to a splitting pain in his head and blinked blearily through tears in the bright morning sun. That was a bad sign for how his day was going to go. Rolling himself up out of the puddle of sewage and rainwater he’d made laying his tired, emaciated bones down to rest last night, he realized he recognized the alley, and even remembered choosing it last night because he could stop at Rose’s for a drink when he woke. Silver linings there.

He had tucked himself into a narrow gutter between two old buildings that forked off a larger alleyway, but he hadn’t figured the sun would have risen right in line.

He patted himself down, starting in his chest and then down to each leg, making sure he still had everything. His purse was alarmingly light, but he was comforted by the familiar weight of the lucky stone in his left pocket. It was the only thing that had managed to hold on to for more than a few days since the Eclipse.
