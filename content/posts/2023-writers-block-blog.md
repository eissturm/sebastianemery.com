Just keep writing.  Just keep writing.  Just keep writing.

That's what they say, but I've never found it that easy to do. This week, for example, I wrote and rewrote the first couple hundred words of what is supposed to be a new chapter in a new part of the book, and even still I'm struggling to think of where to go next. I know what _should_ happen, but each time it feels like I've lost the momentum from the end of the last chapter.

I did make some junk progress today. Who knows if it makes it into the final product, but that's what writing is, right?

Just keep writing.  Just keep writing.  Just keep writing.

It didn't work. Things continued to stall for a couple weeks. I'll blame the travel. Airports and toddlers seem to detract from my productivity, and yet I sure love both of them! The book is seeing some progress, just less than it should. That's going to be a theme here, just you wait and see.
