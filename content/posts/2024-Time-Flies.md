It's been an eventful few months for me.

I started off the year with a lot of energy and excitement to be writing again. I still am, but I've had to delay a lot of the writing for almost the entire past three months. Why? Because life, that's why. A lot has happened in the past three months.

* moved across the country
* joined an exciting, fast moving project at work
* officially in toddler mode now

Reviewing **Spring of Black Flowers** was enlightening. It's both better than I remember it being, and still, definitely, not a good book. It could be a great book after some major structural work and passes for setting and character details, which I don't expect to get to any time soon.
