Another month come and gone. July moved quickly, unlike [*Imperial Heart*](/books/crystal-empire-2), which is now at 80% complete on its first draft. The book is really shaping up. I think its some of my best work yet. While I'm behind my goals, it's definitely rounding the final stretch!

Most of the month was spent on travel. July is a great month to get out of Florida and visit family up north. The kids had a blast. We haven't gotten many places this year, its hard with little kids, but we're excited to do more now that number two is walking.

Looking forward to a productive August. I am trying to make a push and wrap up Imperial Heart before October, though that's probably a stretch.

I hope to have some good Constellara news for everyone soon!

Thanks for reading,
