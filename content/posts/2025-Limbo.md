Been quiet here lately.

Not for lack of love, life just got busy in the New Year. Lot's of changes happening professionally that have, unfortunately, slowed down progress on some of my writing projects. Mostly good things, but change is often painful while its happening.

I've recently been submitting short stories to literary magazines again. I'll be incredibly excited to share the news of any success if or when that finally happens. There are a few other things in the works, hopefully some good fiction for y'all to enjoy soon!

Thanks for hanging in here with me. Until next time.
