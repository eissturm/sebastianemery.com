Weekly updates were not it. Sorry if you were excited about weekly updates, maybe they're something we can do in the future. For now, end-of-month updates will be the goal.

Progress on *Crystal Empire* has been slow. Things at my day job have been crazy, and I've been feeling the same kind of pressure for my time and metal energy as I did before The Gap. Don't worry, we're not looking at another one of those this time around. We push on. I've made some changes on the professional front that should have some positive benefits over the coming weeks.

Really little kids are so much fun, but so much work. I love them, but some days... If I have any fans blame my sons for any delays.

I have a few short pieces working through the grinder, but no good news yet.

In other news, one of my writing group friends launched a book at the end of March called [*Legacy.exe*](https://a.co/d/7w1ZGwZ), and you should do yourself the favor of checking it out.

[J.A. Gillette's](https://www.authorjagillette.com/) cyberbpunk thriller will wrinkle your brain and have you asking all kinds of questions about what it means to be human in a post-scarcity, post-singularity world. I enjoyed it so much I wrote a companion short story, [*LastManStanding.exe*](https://www.patreon.com/posts/lastmanstanding-124446739), available on my Patreon.

Thanks everyone, see ya next month.
