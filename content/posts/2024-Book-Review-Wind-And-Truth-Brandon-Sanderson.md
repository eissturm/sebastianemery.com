I'm going to surprise myself and say that *Wind and Truth* the fifth installment of Brandon Sanderson's fantasy epic *Stormlight Archive* was not my favorite book this year. I fully expected it to be, though I can't fault this book for *Some Desperate Glory* existing in the same year.

For fans of the Stormlight Archive, Wind and Truth is a wild ride through the last ten days of Roshar as we know it. If you're not a fan of the Stormlight Archives already, this is not your jumping on point, this book is not for you.

# Pre-release

Ever since Oathbringer in 2017, Brandon Sanderson has done something very cool in the leadup to his books by releasing the frist couple of hundred pages of the book as weekly chapter drops on Tor's website. Fans were able to read and discuss the weekly chapter drops, and it was an exciting time to be a Sanderson fan. They proceeded to do it again with Rhythm of War and again in 2024 leading up to the release of Wind and Truth. The activity in the community and on discussion boards was built so much hype for each release that I'm not surprised each book has sold better than the last.

I think the amount of hype that this style of release builds is incredible. As a reader and a fan, I wish I could experience more fiction this way. You'll probably see  me do something similar when it comes time to release my own epic fantasy, not that I expect similar results.

# The Review

This review contains spoliers for The Stormlight Archive and Wind and Truth in particular

## The Plot and Pacing

Wind and Truth picks up right where Rhythm of War left off, and is split into ten "parts", one for each of Roshar's last ten days. We follow our familiar heroes as they spread out into the world to prepare for Dalinar and Odium's Contest of Champions, and this time we get solid representation from each of them on the page. Unfortuantely, not all of the plotlines are equal. While Adolin and Shallan's sections are exciting, Kaladin and Dalinar's parts were both plagued with troubles.

### Adolin

Fantastic. No notes. Just go read it.

### Shallan

Shallan hunting the ghostbloods through the spiritual realm was interesting and exciting. It was unfortunately diminished by how intertwined it was around the Dalinar plotline.

### Dalinar

Provided a much needed and highly expository look into the past as a way to keep Dalinar off the field and allow things to fall apart.

### Kaladin and Szeth

Weird. 

## Characters

Adolin good, Kaladin bleh, everyone else fine.

## Setting

Poor Roshar, what have they done to my boy

## Prose

Recent mainline Cosmere books have felt oddly "modern" in their language, and I'm not sure I like it. There were multiple times when I was distracted and taken out of the story by characters doing things that are just "out of character" for the setting.

## Theme

**BONK!** Go to therapy! **BONK!** Go to therapy!

## Fun

The Adolin section was fucking amazing, the rest of it kinda disappointing. 

## Total Score

3.7/5
