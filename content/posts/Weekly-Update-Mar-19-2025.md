Between a busy day job and some sick toddlers, finding the time to write's been harder the past few weeks. Luckily, the words are flowing in the time I've been able to carve out.

Crystal Empire (Epic Fantasy Trilogy)
Writing has been progressing really well on Crystal Empire's second book, Imperial Heart. This sequence has been one of the most difficult to get right, having been through three iterations already, and I think everyone's really going to enjoy this sequence in the final book. I'll just say this: Demara and Kinro have never faced this kind of danger while Mal was around to look out for them.

[ALPHA] Book 1: 100,000 / 100,000 words (100%)

[ALPHA] Book 2: 38,000 / 100,000 words (38%)

Next month's short should be somethingn

Constellara (Sci-fi Shared Universe)
Good news everyone! Look out on Friday for some new Constellara fiction, a fun little romance story titled Date on Denzore.

Our first round of stories for this setting turned out absolutely wonderfully, giving us so many ideas and details to incorporate across eleven different stories and styles. The team is so excited to share some of these with you all when they're ready!
