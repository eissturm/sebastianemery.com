I did it again.

I started blogging, then dropped off the face of the earth for like... eight weeks.  Usually it's more. Sorry?

I tend to overcommit and stretch myself thin. I have too many priorities, and when I have to chose, I tend to pick my most personal objectives last. I haven't been writing much fiction since the new year, despite how energized I was by everything going in. A lot of things have been in flux, all of it good. I hope to share more someday soon here.

This post won't be a long one, nor will it be the last one. It might be the last one from Minnesota though.
