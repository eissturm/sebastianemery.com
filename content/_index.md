## Crystal Empire

> *Demara's world is destroyed every year. Her people have been pushed past the far side of nowhere and to the edge of extinction. In this world, it is only the crystals that keep a tribe safe through the Turnings. Can Demara learn the secrets of the stones at the heart of that yearly apocalypse and save her people, and the world, from their fate? Is she ready for how far that journey will take her?*
